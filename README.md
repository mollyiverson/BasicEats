## Project Description
BasicEats is a recipe sharing website that allows users to search for, view, and save recipes. Users can also generate a weekly shopping list for selected recipes.

## Tools
We will use [Spoonacular's Food API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) for the recipe data. We use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the website interface. We will use some sort of database to save user info and their saved recipes.
